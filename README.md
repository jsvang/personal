# Personal Site Streamlit App

This repository contains a static website and a simple Streamlit application to interact with a demo agent.

## Running the Streamlit app

Install dependencies and launch Streamlit:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app presents a minimal chat interface. Type a message and the agent will echo it back.

## Testing

```
